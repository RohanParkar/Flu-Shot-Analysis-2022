# Flu-Shot-Analysis-2022
Project Description: Flu Shot Analysis 2022

The Flu Shot Analysis 2022 project is a data-driven dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into flu shot distribution and compliance within a hospital network over the course of 2022. This project leverages PostgreSQL for data management and Tableau for visualization, creating an intuitive interface that addresses specific business requirements.

Objectives:
Flu Shot Compliance by Demographics: Analyze flu shot distribution by age, race, and geographic location (county).
Overall Compliance: Calculate the total percentage of patients who received flu shots in 2022.
Running Total of Flu Shots: Track flu shot administration over time to identify trends throughout the year.
Patient Tracking: List active patients and indicate if they received a flu shot, allowing easy reference and tracking.
Data Process:
Imported data from encounters, immunizations, and patient tables into PostgreSQL.
Used SQL queries to:
Identify active patients (those who had interactions with the hospital and were eligible for flu shots).
Aggregate flu shot data by demographic segments (age, race) and time.
Filter patients based on eligibility and flu shot status.
Visualizations:
Flu Shots by Age: A breakdown of flu shot compliance across different age groups.
Flu Shots by Race: A demographic view showing compliance percentages by race.
Geographic Heat Map: Flu shot compliance displayed by county for easy location-based insights.
Running Total Chart: A timeline visualization tracking flu shot distribution across months.
Patient Shot Status List: An interactive table listing patients and their flu shot status for easy referencing.
Tools & Technology:
SQL (PostgreSQL): Data extraction, filtering, and aggregation.
Tableau: Dashboard creation and visualization, providing interactive insights for stakeholders.
This project showcases my expertise in SQL querying, data manipulation, and interactive dashboard design, making complex healthcare data accessible and actionable for decision-makers.
